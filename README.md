# Topopo

Allows the user to organize traverse survey data. Calculates azimuth automagically if reference azimuth (the azimuth from the first point to the second) is provided.

## Usage

The data must be put in order, and the provided reference azimuth must be measured in the clockwise direction. The user may provide as many measurements he or she whishes from the same point, but when moving to the next point of the polygon, the word "Vante" (forward in Portuguese) must be written at the Point column so the program changes the reference azimuth accordingly for all values after that point (yeah, pretty annoying. Should be easier to use in the future).

## Known Issues

   * In ll fields that receive angle values, for angles to be properly computed there must be no extra spaces. Any exceeding space will result in the program not recognizing the the values as angles.

  * Program still doesn't support data persistence. That means there is no way to save the work as of now (yeah, that means the program is pretty useless... oh well ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ). Should be implemented soon, I promise.
 
  * All text is hardcoded in Portuguese, so nothing in english for now. I might as well learn how to use string resourses on Qt framework. Should be done eventually.

  > Program is working. Probably with some bugs, and yet to be implemented features. But well, it runs smoothly (I hope so).
